Therefore, your questionnaire needs to add analytical questions, such as "Through live broadcast, consumers have obtained more information about product quality"

Through the live broadcast, consumers get more information about the appearance of the product

Through the live broadcast, consumers get more information about the product xx (a certain aspect feature)

Then analyze why live broadcast can promote consumption 


MY OWN NOTES:
One of the main reasons why live streaming is so important, for brands and individuals, is because of the level of interaction and engagement it offers. No other platform or marketing strategy allows for such level of interaction. Live streaming also has the highest rate of engagement of all content types.

The genuine interaction that live streaming allows, creates a relationship with viewers. Videos on demand simply can’t create the same feeling because there’s less room for viewers to identify with the presenters.
