Mostly, people of the selected population tend to spend 3-5 hours on the internet outside of work. 

On the question whether or not they have had experience with Taobao Live, the vast majority of the population, which is 478 people (95.41%) replied with yes, which clearly indicates the widespread and popularity of the platform among the Chinese consumers. 23 respondents have not used Taobao Live services before, which accounts to ony 4.59% of the whole population. 

383 respondents (76.45%) indicated that they spend between 1-3 hours a week on Taobao Live and similar live streaming platforms. 106 people responded with 0 hours (21.16%), which can indicate no prior experience with live streaming platforms or less than one hour of time spent on the platforms per week. 11 people replied with 4-6 hours a week (2.20%) and only 1 person claimed to be spending more than 10 hours a week (0.20%), which could account for going on live streaming apps for one and a half hour each day. Apparently, none of the respondents was spending 7-9 hours a week on the platforms. 

Concerning how efficient in terms of attracting attention respondents consider the platform to be, 213 people (42.51%) agreed that live streaming has provided a better environment for drawing people's attention, while a slightly smaller number of participants, 199 people (39.72%) responded neutral. 77 people (15.37%) did not agree with the statement, 11 people (2.20%) strongly agreed and 1 person (0.20%) strongly disagreed.

As a result we have 240 respondents (47%) out of 501 who appreciate or highly appreciate the platform for being interactive, and only 79 (16%) who did not. 

212 participants (42.32%) supposed that through live streaming they can receive essentially more information about the product than through any other medium. 184 people (36.73%) responded neutrally, 77 disagreed (15.37%), 27 people strongly agreed (5.39%) and one person strongly disagreed. This shows that more than a half of the participants either agrees upon live streaming being an informative medium or is neutral about it, with an insignificant number of people having the opposite opinion.
