“Given the relevance of social media to various stakeholders, and the numerous consequences associated with its use, social media has attracted the attention of researchers from various fields”

“Publications in 2011 were still reporting user-generated content as a new type of online content. However, the last six years have seen tremendous scholarly progression in discussing the many applications of social networking, highlighting
 the highs and lows associated with its use.”

“Publications have become more focussed on studying social commerce across networking sites, particularly, Facebook, MySpace, YouTube and so on between 2015 and 2016.”

Most of the outside world online applications, such as Google, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter are blocked in China due to censorship, which allows domestic channels to thrive.
