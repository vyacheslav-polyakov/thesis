Shopping live-streaming relies on influencer marketing to make a profit. There are two types of live-streaming for shopping: one has its own online shopping platform like Tmall/Taobao, it makes a profit through selling products and aim to create a closed-loop from platform traffic to transaction. The other one is the content platform like Douyin, it doesnâ€™t have its own online marketplace and has to rely on traffic for survival. These platforms either sell their traffic to online shopping platforms like Taobao and JD.com for entry traffic or other platforms for an advertising fee.

Shopping live-streamers are mostly good-looking and witty, they have professional knowledge, value consumers, know how to interact through live-streaming and understand what customers like.
